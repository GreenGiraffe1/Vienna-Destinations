# Vienna Vacation - Neighborhood Map

**Vienna Vacation - Neighborhood Map** is a project that displays my 7 favorite
 vacation destinations in Vienna, and provides some information about each...


### Setup:
<!-- Begin the setup by cloning all files to the same directory, and making sure that Python 2.7x is installed. You'll need to create a new Google Cloud Platform Console project or retrieve the project ID of an existing project from the Google Cloud Platform Console. Then install and then initialize the Google Cloud SDK.

Detailed Instructions can be found here:
[Google App Engine Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/getting-started/creating-guestbook) -->

### Usage:

<!-- To begin using this webpage all make sure all files are in the same directory,
and that Python is installed. Then, launch **entertainment_center.py**. This
project was written using Python 2.7. Other versions may produce errors. -->


### Examples:

<!-- If you'd like to display your own favorite movies instead of the ones
provided, you will need to create new objects for them as below:

```
movie_identifier = media.Movie("Movie title", "Movie Tag Line",
                               "Movie Box Art URL", "Movie Trailer URL")
```

For the HTML to display correctly, there must be exactly 6 "Movie" objects. -->


### Attribution:

<!-- This project was written while I was taking the Udacity Full-Stack Nanodegree,
and significant chunks of the structure / ideas behind the structure were
provided by the course author. Specifically, the file **fresh\_tomatoes.py**
was contributed almost in its entirety by the course author. -->
